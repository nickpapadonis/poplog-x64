HELP DATAFILE                                       David Hogg, Feb 1982

The procedure datafile allows certain Pop-11 data structures to be
recorded on disk, and subsequently read back. To write a structure to
disk, use:

    struct -> datafile(filename);

Similarly, to read a structure back from disk, use:

    datafile(filename) -> struct;

The permitted datatypes are:

    Words, numbers, lists, vector types, record types, arrays,
    ordinary properties, booleans.
